# Torpedo
Torpedo is a test suite to qualify storage providers for stateful containers running in a cluster.  It tests various scenarios that applications encounter when running in Linux containers and deployed via schedulers such as Marathon, Kubernetes or Swarm.

## Background
This test suite will natively support the CSI specification for external volume support into Mesosphere and Kubernetes.

However, at the time of this writing, CSI is currently still work in progress, so most schedulers provide external volume support to Mesosphere or Kubernetes via DVDI or Kubernetes native driver interface.

Docker volume driver interface (DVDI) provides the control path operations to create, mount, unmount and eventually delete an external volume.

The core interaction between the Docker runtime and the Portworx endpoint are documented here: https://github.com/portworx/px-docs/blob/gh-pages/scheduler/docker/volume_plugin.md

This document covers the various scheduler-storage integration points that are being addressed by the CSI specification (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JMNVNP-ZHz8cGlnqckOnpJmHF-DNY7IYP-Di7iuVhQI/edit#) and how external volume providers like Portworx are able to support CSI with DVDI today.

## Usage

Torpedo runs as a Docker container:

```
# docker run 														\
	-e DOCKER_HOST=127.0.0.1										\
	-e CLUSTER_NODES="192.168.1.100,192.168.1.101,192.168.1.102"	\
	torpedo <scheduler> <storage driver>
```

Where:
* DOCKER_HOST is optional.  When specified, the Docker driver will use this variable to talk to the Docker daemon.  By default, it will use `unix:///var/run/docker.sock`.
* CLUSTER_NODES is a list of all the members in this cluster.  Some tests require a minimum cluster size and may not pass if there are not enough hosts in the cluster.

### Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the
